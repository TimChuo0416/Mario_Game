## Advanced Component Description : 

Describe your advanced function and how to use it.

SelectStage:
I created a separate scene as the SelectStage, where Mario can be controlled to choose a level and view the leaderboard.

Leaderboard:
In the center of the SelectStage, there is a leaderboard that displays the top five players. Simply move close to the signboard and press E to view the leaderboard.

POWERUP:
The third type of item. When collected, Mario becomes larger. The next time he is hit by an enemy, he will shrink instead of dying immediately.
